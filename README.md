# Crossover Study

This repository contains the code for my Evo* 2024 paper, with the goal of researching the effect of optimal genetic material on the performance and population dynamics in evolutionary algorithms. This is basically an extension to the Genome Study work for SSCI 2023.


## Folder Structure
There are three folders for the code, data and figures generated by the evaluation:
- *code* - contains all the code, most importantly the script for generating the test data and the jupyter notebook used for evaluation. Besides the test scripts, code from the preliminary evaluation as well as the sub-repository for the T-EA is also here.
- *data* - is the output folder for the test data, both for the preliminary test and the actual benchmark. Also already contains the compressed test data of the tests.
- *figures* - contains the generated pdf figures from the evaluation of the data.

## Installing

The t-ea pymoo implementation is required to run the code in this repository.

The required packages can be found in "requirements.txt".
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

Finally, two sub-directories are needed for the test problems and the heritage tracking. They can be initalized as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobeneck/crossover_study.git
cd crossover_study
git submodule init
git submuodule update
cd ../pymoo_problems
git submodule init
git submuodule update
```

For more information on the heritage tracking process of the traceable evolutionary algorithm (T-EA) you can refer to [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9504916), the implementation can be found in [this git repository](https://github.com/tobeneck/tea_pymoo).

The repository containing the problem implementations outside of pymoo can be found [here](https://github.com/tobeneck/pymoo_problems).


## Generating the Test Data

Generating the test data is done in a few separate steps. The data will always be saved in the *data* folder.

1. Generating the initial populations and seed individuals:
```bash
cd code
python3 generate_initial_pop.py
python3 generate_seed_individuals.py
```

2. Run the actual tests:
```bash
python3 e_and_c_benchmark.py
```

3. Calculate the hypervolume performance indicator:
```bash
python3 calc_HV.py
```

4. Evaluate the tests with *e_and_c_evaluation.ipynb*.
