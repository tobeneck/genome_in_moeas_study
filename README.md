# Crossover Study

This repository contains the code for my Evo* 2024 paper, with the goal of researching the effect of optimal genetic material on the performance and population dynamics in evolutionary algorithms. This is basically an extension to the Genome Study work for SSCI 2023.


## Folder Structure
There are three folders for the code, data and figures generated by the evaluation:
- *code* - contains all the code, most importantly the script for generating the test data and the jupyter notebook used for evaluation. Besides the test scripts, code from the preliminary evaluation as well as the sub-repository for the T-EA is also here.
- *data* - is the output folder for the test data, both for the preliminary test and the actual benchmark. Also already contains the compressed test data of the tests.
- *figures* - contains the generated pdf figures from the evaluation of the data.

## Installing

The t-ea pymoo implementation is required to run the code in this repository.

The required packages can be found in "requirements.txt".
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

Finally, for the heritage tracking, for the heritage tracking using the T-EA, it is required to initialize the sub-repositors.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobeneck/crossover_study.git
cd crossover_study
git submodule init
git submuodule update
```

## Generating the Test Data

As mentioned, the test data is already available in the *data/sphere_function_data_out* folder.
This test data is generated using the *code/benchmark_sphere.py* script:
```bash
cd code
python3 benchmark_sphere.py
```

The output of the test data woll be saved to the *data* folder. It can be evaluated using the *code/eval_sphree.ipynb* notebook.

## Citation

Will be added if this work gets published.
